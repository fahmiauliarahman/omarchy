// Lock OSD -- a headless Omarchy shell service.
//
// Purpose: raise the stock OSD when Caps Lock or Num Lock changes state, so a
// toggle is never silent. No UI of its own; it observes two files and spawns
// one `omarchy-shell osd show` per genuine transition.
//
// Detection: the kernel already tracks both locks, and the LED class exposes a
// node per lock under /sys/class/leds/<input>::<lock>/brightness holding "0" or
// "1", kept current by the LED-class kbd-capslock / kbd-numlock triggers
// whenever the compositor changes lock state. A read costs ~0.06ms, so the
// primary path re-reads both every 100ms and compares inside onLoaded -- the
// load is asynchronous, so text() is only current there and never straight
// after reload().
//
// The <input> half of those paths is machine-specific, so it is discovered once
// at startup rather than hardcoded: an earlier revision pinned input4 and was
// therefore dead on every machine but the author's. Discovery is a single fork
// for the whole session, filtered on the trigger actually being offered, and
// the answer is cached. A node exists whether or not the keyboard has a
// physical lock LED -- it is a state mirror, not a light -- so a laptop with no
// visible LED still reports correctly. A machine with no such node at all falls
// back to hyprctl alone, which is the same path a dead channel takes.
////
// Safety net: every 5s hyprctl is asked for the device list, aggregated as "any
// device reports true". Those capsLock/numLock fields are per-device, and a
// virtual or hotplugged device can latch true while the real lock is off, so
// hyprctl never overrides a live sysfs channel -- it only drives state where
// sysfs is unreadable. While sysfs is live the reconcile is diagnostics only:
// it warns once when the two disagree, which is what turns a silent detection
// failure into a visible one instead of a flip-flop every 5s. Both paths funnel
// through applyLockState(), the single place a value is compared against the one
// already held, so no transition is announced twice.
//
// Cost: ~0.12% of one core, zero forks per tick (two 0.06ms reads at 10Hz).
// One fork resolves the LED paths at startup and the 5s reconcile is the only
// periodic one; the OSD only spawns when a lock actually changed.
//
// The root is an Item, as every other service plugin here is, purely to own the
// children. It has no window and no visual child, so nothing reaches the scene
// graph: the shell's own service host is an `Item { visible: false }` for the
// same reason.
